# Cancer-cells-counting-in-a-co-cultured-image
This algorithm performs automated detection, measurement, and leveling of co-cultured cells. Each cells are identified and characterized by probablistic hesitant fuzzy set with several local descriptors (entropy, fuzzy index, fuzzy conectivity,etc. ), which are used to define an optimal threshold to segment  individual cells.
